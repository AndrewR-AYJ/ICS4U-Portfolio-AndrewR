Communicating With Markdown

  Communicating with markdown is an important course for me as this was the first look I had at code this year. It was a while 
since I had last done any code, but this course was perfect for me. This was the basics of markdown, and I mean the fundamentals.
This was, personally, simpler than Intro to HTML was on Khan Academy. This was the base of everything we were learning this
semester. And, again, it was a really good start.

  To continue learning about markdown, it's just an issue of practicing making websites. That practice that I can get through Atom
will help to further improve my ability and get me comfortable with using markdown and HTML.

  To me, the most influencial aspect of this course was that it didn't go into any of the confusing aspects of HTML, since Github 
has another course for that, which is their own intro to HTML. This course simply taught you the basics of how markdown was going 
to work, and how to use it. I think the idea of having a markdown course and an HTML one is quite smart, especially if you're a 
beginner when it comes to code. This warms you up quite a bit for HTML, which isn't much more confusing than this, but it allows 
Github to elaborate more into HTML and use terms that they know you'll understand since you took the markdown course.
