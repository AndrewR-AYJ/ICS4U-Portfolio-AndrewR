Summarize your experience on Khan Academy.

My experience on Khan Academy was great. It starts you off with some pretty basic stuff, then progressively gets more challenging,
which I not only think is smart, but I think was very well executed. We started off learning HTML/CSS, which was a great start
since I personally didn't find markdown too confusing. So, it was almost like a warm up to me: I learned a new language and was
ready for whatever was to come next. Khan Academy held your hand quite well through the course too, explaining everything in detail
and with videos that weren't hard to understand. Then, we did JavaScript, which was something new, and a bit harder at that. But, 
still, Khan Academy held your hand through it really well, and I got through it feeling accomplished, and without too many
problems. Then came Natural Simulations, were physics was starting to be involved. This was quite a bit harder than JS to me, but
not unfairly. It took everything I learned from JS and expanded on it a lot, and I ended up learning a lot. And so on, so forth.
The difficulty scaling was very well executed, and it made my experience through Khan Academy really well.
