Community Starter Kit

  The community starter kit on Github is the first project given on Github as a tutorial. It was the first project I had completed
on Github, and I feel that it was a very important one.

  To continue learning as a computer science student on Github, I will look at other people's projects to see how they've formatted
everything so that I can get ideas that way. Since Github has such an enormous user base, I will be able to get plenty of different
perspectives on how to do certain things, which will be very helpful to me and save me a lot of trouble (of not only figuring it
out, but also of ordering everything in a way that is easy to access).

  This project had a impact on me because it was the first project that I had worked on on Github. It made me use everything I had
learned up to that point in order to create a proper repository on a topic. This project helped to solidify my ability to work with
Github and it's features, and solidified me as a member of it's community (the importance of which I mentioned in my Github
slideshow).
