Microbit

Microbit was a very interesting concept to be able to work on. It allowed us to use the skills we were developping through
Khan academy in a new fashion. This project had us using these small microbits that had multiple programmable features.
Mohammed and I had worked on bluetooth, where the microbit would make a sound and could be controlled using bluetooth (outputted
through devices, controlled on the phone).
  
  This can be used to further my knowledge since it's almost unconventional. Coding on a
Microbit is different from coding on a program since the microbit has features that you can interact with in real life, since it's 
a physical object you can hold. This lets you put your coding skills into practice in a different way, instead of always getting an
output on screen. This can make coding more interesting if you're not used to it, especially since the Microbit has features that
are specific only to itself, since, again, it's a physical object. It's a very special piece of technology that can do many things,
and help you look at code at multiple different angles.

  This is also what had the most impact on me. While I had a good time coding on Khan Academy and coding in C++ last year, the
Microbit was something I have never seen before in my life. It was interesting to see everything you were doing appear on a small
CPU. The tutorials given where also great, and gave me insight on things I've never even though of coding before, since either I
wasn't experienced enough on they weren't possible/conventional on something that wasn't a Microbit. Since I also didn't know
JavaScript well at the time, the use of the block coding helped me built my logic and my ability to produce functioning code in
general, which is always good to have.
