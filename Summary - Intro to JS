Intro to JS

  The intro to JS was the first look at JavaScript that I had. This was a very useful module to start, as I learned a new language,
but it was also very well explained. Intro to JS uses videos to explain all of it's concepts, which I personally found very useful.
It held my hand well through learning the language, as it understood that this would be the first look that people have at JS. So,
they efficiently go slow and explain everything to you: why something will happen, what it does, how it's useful, and etc. It was a
fantastic starting point to being able to code with JS, and to the other JS courses that Khan Academy has to offer.

  To continue to learn JS as a student, I will indulge in Khan Academy's other JS courses. In class we completed Natural
Simulations and Algorithms, which taught me a lot too. With the knowledge from all three of these courses, I can confidently start
other ones on Khan Academy to continue to learn about the language (things like syntax) and how I can use said things to create
code.

  What had the most significant impact on me was the fact that I had learned JS. JS has a lot of potential as a language. It can do
A LOT of things. Lorenz Curves, artwork, and can even work with the laws of physics to make a code incredibly realistic. Because of
that fact, this is something that I personally find to be a great tool to use. I am a huge fan of art, be it music, visual, or
more. JavaScript is great for art, since you can create a bunch of amazing shapes using syntax and mess with colours, so it's
wonderful for me to have a new medium in which I can create something.
