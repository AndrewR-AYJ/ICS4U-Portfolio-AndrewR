Algorithms

  The algorithms course on Khan Academy focuses on teaching you not only the basics of algorithms (what they are, how they work),
but also many different ways to look at them and the many different ways they're used. This course, in my opinion, really helps to 
improve your logic and ability to code in general, since algorithms are very logic based. It's all based on the steps taken to make
something function, which makes you examine exactly how and why everything is working. Not only does this course teach you
something brand new, it forces you to improve your fundamentals, if even indirectly.

  I can continue to learn through algorithms by practicing with the rubix cubes. I can presently solve a pyramix, and practicing
that would help me with my work on algorithms, but learning new cubes would be great. The rubix cubes all follow algorithms, and
a majority of the way you're going to solve them is through use of said algorithms. So, the more cubes I learn to solve, the more
algorithms I can learn, and the more ability I have with understanding how algorithms work. The cubes are almost another way to
view computer science as a whole, except in a simpler, easier to digest form. They give you the basics you need in order to learn
how everything will work, and even how to follow order in your code (can help you learn where to place what in your code so that it
works properly, since the cubes teach you about doing everything step by step). They are a great tool for learning computer
science as a topic.

  The most impactful thing about this course has to be the premise of algorithms that I was taught. It helps me understand a little
more about order in my code, and helps my fundamentals out a lot with the use of logic. Algorithms is very math based and doesn't
have any concepts that would drag on, per se, they get to the point and teach you what you want to know. I really valued that out
of this experience.
