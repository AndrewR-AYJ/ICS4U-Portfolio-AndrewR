FCC: Basic HTML and HTML5
(*Note: Free Code Camp will be referred to as "FCC" in this paragraph*)

  Doing HTML on FCC wasn't the hardest thing in the world for me, since I had previously done Khan Academy's "Intro to
HTML" and multiple courses on GitHub explaining markdown and HTML to me. However, I still feel like FCC helped me with
their set of challenges I had done. This served more as a review for me, one which polished what I had already known about HTML and
that had reminded me of so many things about the language, since the last time I did work regarding HTML was at the beginning of 
the semester.

  But, obviously, the HTML courses on Khan Academy and FCC are not the same. While they both teach you everything you
need to know about HTML, they teach you in a different fashion, which gives me another angle to look at how to code using markdown.
There are times where I actually understood things better, since they were explained differently here than they were on Khan
Academy. This furthered the knowledge I had built with HTML more, which was in my opinion, the most impactful thing that I took out
of working on FCC.

  I can continue code as a student by creating more websites using markdown, which will give me lots of practice with the language.
