Summarize your experience on Free Code Camp.

My experience on Free Code Camp was very interesting. I did the more basic courses on FCC, like Basic HTML and Basic CSS. Some of
these parts acted as a review for me, but I did get something really good out of it. FCC is, obviously, different from Khan
Academy. Therefore, they taught things differently than Khan Academy did when I first learned HTML and CSS. This gave me a new
angle on how to look at these languages, since there were times where I actually found that FCC explained things better to me than
Khan Academy did. FCC also had split courses for HTML and CSS, which I though was really smart. This meant that FCC could go into
more detail into one course than Khan Academy could without making it overbearingly long. That being the case, some things could be
explained with more detail, and some things could be taught that Khan Academy couldn't teach. I found this to be useful, and came
out of FCC with more knowledge on HTML and CSS than I had previously.
