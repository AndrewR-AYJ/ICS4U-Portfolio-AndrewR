Advanced JS: Natural Simulations

  Natural Simulations is the course I did on Khan Academy after completing Intro to JS. This course delves into using real life
"properties" as a way to code. For example, a good piece of the course focuses on physics, and applies it's concepts
(Newton's laws, velocities, and more) into your code. This makes your code work around the functions of real life, and it's very
interesting to see. This is something I honestly didn't even know was possible, or would've thought to be possible. It's quite
impressive.

  To continue learning about natural simulations using JS, I could study AI a bit more. There are multiple videos on youtube in
which people will code AI and have them learn over time, which I think is absolutely insane. Studying this could give me insight
on looking at natural simulations in different situations, instead of mostly with physics. I could also look at more of Dan
Shiffman's coding challenges, as a lot of them are based on natural things (like the lorenz curve and it's equations, the fire
effect, the water ripple, and etc.) This will teach me more on how to code things the way the world makes said things happen. I
could also look at more concepts with physics and other topics and try to code them myself, and see what kind of results I get.
There are plenty of possibilities with natural simulations.

  The most significant impact of this course was simply how much it taught me about code. This is not a way I thought code would
work, I always thought it was based on general math equations and your logic. While logic is still a basis for code, there are so
many other concepts that are brought into coding that can be used to create whatever you desire. And in extreme detail, too.
Literally, the possibilities for what we can do with the code, I feel, are endless. That fact gives me motivation to continue
coding, as now I know I can code absolutely anything.
