Intro to HTML

  Intro to HTML was the first course I had where I really explored HTML as a language. I had looked at it previously on Github,
but this course gave me everything I needed to know on how to code using markdown. This was a great start to getting into the
semester. I find that (out of what I did, anyway) HTML is not the most difficult language in the world to understand, and it's
fairly easy to pick up. That being said, it does have plenty of uses that will help me in the future. It is designed to help you
create websites, and to do so in a very creative way. Khan Academy also teaches it very well, as they use videos in which they
explain everything to you slowly and in a way that's easy to comprehend. They don't use crazy extensive vocabulary and try to keep
it simple, while also delivering the information you want. The fact that it wasn't too hard to learn also made it a great segway
into learning JavaScript, since I was warmed up and ready to learn a new language.

  To continue learning HTML, I can start making websites for fun. I installed "Atom" to make a website for my ISC4U exam, which
means I now have an efficient program that I can use to make websites. This will give me more practice with HTML (which will not
only make me more comfortable with it, but also prompt me to search for syntax I don't know or ways to do things on the internet,
which will help me in the long run as I'll be able to code more).

  The most impactful part of this course was teaching me to create websites. Websites are very useful nowadays, as every major
company, celebrity or government has one. Anybody can have a website, and they are all useful and great in their own ways. This
will help me a lot in the future, as I can maybe make a blog to express how I'm feeling with others, or make a website for myself
if I ever decide to go freelance (this way I also won't have to hire anyone and can just do it myself). So, creating a website
would be great for me in the future.
