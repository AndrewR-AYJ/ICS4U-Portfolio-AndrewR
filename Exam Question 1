How can art/physics help guide you through learning about programming and computer science?

Brainstorm:
-gives you a back up understanding of what you're coding
-gives you more of a motivation to code
-allows you to accomplish your physics or art goals in a different fashion (makes it interesting, and possibly faster).
 This can get you more into code as well, since it's another way to do what you want

Paragraph:
  Art and physics are two concepts that I feel can be very important while you code. Physics defines how the world works, how it should
work: while art is an art that shows the creative ability that human can posess. So, how would the two factors help you learn in CS?
  
  Well, JavaScript is a great language that can help you learn a lot using your art and physics skills. JavaScript can be used in a very
artistic way through use of their shapes
