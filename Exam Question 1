How can art/physics help guide you through learning about programming and computer science?

Brainstorm:
-gives you a back up understanding of what you're coding
-gives you more of a motivation to code
-allows you to accomplish your physics or art goals in a different fashion (makes it interesting, and possibly faster).
 This can get you more into code as well, since it's another way to do what you want

Paragraph:
  Art and physics are two concepts that I feel can be very important while you code. Physics defines a lot of how the world works
