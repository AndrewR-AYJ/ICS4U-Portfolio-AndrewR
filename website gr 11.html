        <h3 class ="module" id="introHTML">Khan Academy: Intro to HTML</h3>
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewR-AYJ/ICS4U-Portfolio-AndrewR/master/intoHTMLpic.PNG" title="Source: Khan Academy.com"/>
          <p> Intro to HTML was the first course I had where I really explored HTML as a language. I had looked at it previously on Github,
but this course gave me everything I needed to know on how to code using markdown. This was a great start to getting into the
semester. I find that (out of what I did, anyway) HTML is not the most difficult language in the world to understand, and it's
fairly easy to pick up. That being said, it does have plenty of uses that will help me in the future. It is designed to help you
create websites, and to do so in a very creative way. Khan Academy also teaches it very well, as they use videos in which they
explain everything to you slowly and in a way that's easy to comprehend. They don't use crazy extensive vocabulary and try to keep
it simple, while also delivering the information you want. The fact that it wasn't too hard to learn also made it a great segway
into learning JavaScript, since I was warmed up and ready to learn a new language.

  To continue learning HTML, I can start making websites for fun. I installed "Atom" to make a website for my ISC4U exam, which
means I now have an efficient program that I can use to make websites. This will give me more practice with HTML (which will not
only make me more comfortable with it, but also prompt me to search for syntax I don't know or ways to do things on the internet,
which will help me in the long run as I'll be able to code more).

  The most impactful part of this course was teaching me to create websites. Websites are very useful nowadays, as every major
company, celebrity or government has one. Anybody can have a website, and they are all useful and great in their own ways. This
will help me a lot in the future, as I can maybe make a blog to express how I'm feeling with others, or make a website for myself
if I ever decide to go freelance (this way I also won't have to hire anyone and can just do it myself). So, creating a website
would be great for me in the future.</p>
        <h3 class ="module" id="introJS">Khan Academy: Intro to JS</h3>
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewR-AYJ/ICS4U-Portfolio-AndrewR/master/js1.PNG"</img>
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewR-AYJ/ICS4U-Portfolio-AndrewR/master/js2.PNG" title="Source: Khan Academy.com"/img>
          <p>The intro to JS was the first look at JavaScript that I had. This was a very useful module to start, as I learned a new language,
but it was also very well explained. Intro to JS uses videos to explain all of it's concepts, which I personally found very useful.
It held my hand well through learning the language, as it understood that this would be the first look that people have at JS. So,
they efficiently go slow and explain everything to you: why something will happen, what it does, how it's useful, and etc. It was a
fantastic starting point to being able to code with JS, and to the other JS courses that Khan Academy has to offer.

  To continue to learn JS as a student, I will indulge in Khan Academy's other JS courses. In class we completed Natural
Simulations and Algorithms, which taught me a lot too. With the knowledge from all three of these courses, I can confidently start
other ones on Khan Academy to continue to learn about the language (things like syntax) and how I can use said things to create
code.

  What had the most significant impact on me was the fact that I had learned JS. JS has a lot of potential as a language. It can do
A LOT of things. Lorenz Curves, artwork, and can even work with the laws of physics to make a code incredibly realistic. Because of
that fact, this is something that I personally find to be a great tool to use. I am a huge fan of art, be it music, visual, or
more. JavaScript is great for art, since you can create a bunch of amazing shapes using syntax and mess with colours, so it's
wonderful for me to have a new medium in which I can create something.</p>

        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewR-AYJ/ICS4U-Portfolio-AndrewR/master/ns2.PNG" title="Source: Khan Academy.com"/img>
          <p> Natural Simulations is the course I did on Khan Academy after completing Intro to JS. This course delves into using real life
"properties" as a way to code. For example, a good piece of the course focuses on physics, and applies it's concepts
(Newton's laws, velocities, and more) into your code. This makes your code work around the functions of real life, and it's very
interesting to see. This is something I honestly didn't even know was possible, or would've thought to be possible. It's quite
impressive.

  To continue learning about natural simulations using JS, I could study AI a bit more. There are multiple videos on youtube in
which people will code AI and have them learn over time, which I think is absolutely insane. Studying this could give me insight
on looking at natural simulations in different situations, instead of mostly with physics. I could also look at more of Dan
Shiffman's coding challenges, as a lot of them are based on natural things (like the lorenz curve and it's equations, the fire
effect, the water ripple, and etc.) This will teach me more on how to code things the way the world makes said things happen. I
could also look at more concepts with physics and other topics and try to code them myself, and see what kind of results I get.
There are plenty of possibilities with natural simulations.

  The most significant impact of this course was simply how much it taught me about code. This is not a way I thought code would
work, I always thought it was based on general math equations and your logic. While logic is still a basis for code, there are so
many other concepts that are brought into coding that can be used to create whatever you desire. And in extreme detail, too.
Literally, the possibilities for what we can do with the code, I feel, are endless. That fact gives me motivation to continue
coding, as now I know I can code absolutely anything.</p>
        <h3 class ="module" id="algorithms">Khan Academy: Algorithms</h3>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewR-AYJ/ICS4U-Portfolio-AndrewR/master/a1.PNG"</img>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewR-AYJ/ICS4U-Portfolio-AndrewR/master/a2.PNG" title="Source: Khan Academy.com"/img>
          <p> The algorithms course on Khan Academy focuses on teaching you not only the basics of algorithms (what they are, how they work),
but also many different ways to look at them and the many different ways they're used. This course, in my opinion, really helps to
improve your logic and ability to code in general, since algorithms are very logic based. It's all based on the steps taken to make
something function, which makes you examine exactly how and why everything is working. Not only does this course teach you
something brand new, it forces you to improve your fundamentals, if even indirectly.

  I can continue to learn through algorithms by practicing with the rubix cubes. I can presently solve a pyramix, and practicing
that would help me with my work on algorithms, but learning new cubes would be great. The rubix cubes all follow algorithms, and
a majority of the way you're going to solve them is through use of said algorithms. So, the more cubes I learn to solve, the more
algorithms I can learn, and the more ability I have with understanding how algorithms work. The cubes are almost another way to
view computer science as a whole, except in a simpler, easier to digest form. They give you the basics you need in order to learn
how everything will work, and even how to follow order in your code (can help you learn where to place what in your code so that it
works properly, since the cubes teach you about doing everything step by step). They are a great tool for learning computer
science as a topic.

  The most impactful thing about this course has to be the premise of algorithms that I was taught. It helps me understand a little
more about order in my code, and helps my fundamentals out a lot with the use of logic. Algorithms is very math based and doesn't
have any concepts that would drag on, per se, they get to the point and teach you what you want to know. I really valued that out
of this experience.</p>
        <h3 class ="module" id="FCC_html">Free Code Camp: Basic HTML and HTML 5</h3>
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewR-AYJ/ICS4U-Portfolio-AndrewR/master/html2.PNG" title="Free Code Camp.com"/img>
          <p>(*Note: Free Code Camp will be referred to as "FCC" in this paragraph*)<br>

  Doing HTML on FCC wasn't the hardest thing in the world for me, since I had previously done Khan Academy's "Intro to
HTML" and multiple courses on GitHub explaining markdown and HTML to me. However, I still feel like FCC helped me with
their set of challenges I had done. This served more as a review for me, one which polished what I had already known about HTML and
that had reminded me of so many things about the language, since the last time I did work regarding HTML was at the beginning of
the semester.

  But, obviously, the HTML courses on Khan Academy and FCC are not the same. While they both teach you everything you
need to know about HTML, they teach you in a different fashion, which gives me another angle to look at how to code using markdown.
There are times where I actually understood things better, since they were explained differently here than they were on Khan
Academy. This furthered the knowledge I had built with HTML more, which was in my opinion, the most impactful thing that I took out
of working on FCC.

I can continue code as a student by creating more websites using markdown, which will give me lots of practice with the language.</p>
        <h3 class ="module" id="FCC_css">Free Code Camp: Basic CSS</h3>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewR-AYJ/ICS4U-Portfolio-AndrewR/master/fcchtml1.PNG" title="Free Code Camp.com"/img>
          <p>I liked basic CSS for a lot of the same reasons that I did the Basic HTML course on FCC. Once again, this course helped me review
everything I had previously learned on Khan Academy, but with a bunch of new angles to look from. The end of this course actually
had a few things I don't remember originally learning on Khan Academy, so I came out of using FCC with more knowledge than I had
before. CSS is something that I personally really like to use, since most of it is based around styling your website and making it
look nice, which is something I really like to do with other things in my free time. So, I had quite an enjoyable experience with
this course. It's also worth noting that FCC has two different courses on both HTML and CSS, while Khan Academy merged them into
one. While I have no problem having them merged, having them seperate gives FCC more opportunities to expand onto the topic, as
they have more dedicated to it, which is why I believe I came out of this course knowing more about CSS than I did to begin with.

    To continue to learn about CSS, I will practice extensively styling my websites with whatever I can. Not to the point where I
overdo it, of course, but enough that I can retain the knowledge I have learned form Khan Academy and FCC. They both taught me a
lot of syntax and tips on how to make your code look good (ex: when to italicise, when to bold, how to properly use margins, etc.)
which is something that is very useful and something that I'm personally really grateful for.

  As I had mentioned in the previous paragraph, the most impactful thing to me was the fact that I now had a new medium to try and
display my art and to be creative. CSS allows you to really spice up any website you have and make it look great, which I find to
be really important and very pretty if done well. Previously, I wouldn't have been able to do it well with my basic knowledge of
only HTML, but with CSS, the possibilities have increased a lot. There are now so many options and things I can do, and I'm very
glad to be able to do them.</p>
        <h3 class ="module" id="Git_slideshow">Github: Github Slideshow</h3>
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewR-AYJ/ICS4U-Portfolio-AndrewR/master/g_slide1.PNG" title="Github.com"/img>
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewR-AYJ/ICS4U-Portfolio-AndrewR/master/g_slide2.PNG" title="Github.com"/img>
          <p>The Github slideshow is an introductory course to Github and all of it's features. It gives you the basics of how to use
everything on github and how to get the max value out of it. It teaches you why Github is useful and why you would want to use it
for your projects. I really enjoyed this course because of my introduction to Github, which I think is an important platform for
any aspiring computer scientists.

  To continue to learn about Github, I'll put any projects or websites I complete on the website so that I can make sure I have a
complete understanding of everything I'm doing. I can also start projects with friends of mine, and we can all work on a repository
together to get it done. This would get me used to and teach me things about the collaborative aspect to Github, which is one of
it's strongest features. I could also simply help a stranger on one of their projects, or just review their code and make comments
on it to suggest improvements. There are plenty of things I can find on Github that would make me a more active member of it's
community.

  The thing that had an impact on me from this module was definetly just the ability I have now to use Github. Github is, in my
opinion, very important for any computer scientist to use. You can put everything you make here and have not only a safe, easy
access place for it, but also a place where others can help you with your code. There are so many users on Github that are all
ready and willing to lend you a helping hand, no matter your skill level. That is always great to have, and something that should
really be valued. Even if comments aren't made specifically on your code, you have a huge FAQ section you can visit to try and find
a solution to any problem you might be having, or to help others with theirs. This is a great community that I'm proud to be a part
of.</p>
        <h3 class ="module" id="Git_starter">Github: Community Starter Kit</h3>
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewR-AYJ/ICS4U-Portfolio-AndrewR/master/g_starter1.PNG" title="Github.com"/img>
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewR-AYJ/ICS4U-Portfolio-AndrewR/master/g_starter2.PNG" title="Github.com"/img>
          <p> The community starter kit on Github is the first project given on Github as a tutorial. It was the first project I had completed
on Github, and I feel that it was a very important one.

  To continue learning as a computer science student on Github, I will look at other people's projects to see how they've formatted
everything so that I can get ideas that way. Since Github has such an enormous user base, I will be able to get plenty of different
perspectives on how to do certain things, which will be very helpful to me and save me a lot of trouble (of not only figuring it
out, but also of ordering everything in a way that is easy to access).

  This project had a impact on me because it was the first project that I had worked on on Github. It made me use everything I had
learned up to that point in order to create a proper repository on a topic. This project helped to solidify my ability to work with
Github and it's features, and solidified me as a member of it's community (the importance of which I mentioned in my Github
slideshow).</p>
        <h3 class ="module" id="Git_markdown">Github: Communicating With Markdown</h3>
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewR-AYJ/ICS4U-Portfolio-AndrewR/master/g_markdown.PNG" title="Github.com"/img>
          <p> Communicating with markdown is an important course for me as this was the first look I had at code this year. It was a while
since I had last done any code, but this course was perfect for me. This was the basics of markdown, and I mean the fundamentals.
This was, personally, simpler than Intro to HTML was on Khan Academy. This was the base of everything we were learning this
semester. And, again, it was a really good start.

  To continue learning about markdown, it's just an issue of practicing making websites. That practice that I can get through Atom
will help to further improve my ability and get me comfortable with using markdown and HTML.

  To me, the most influencial aspect of this course was that it didn't go into any of the confusing aspects of HTML, since Github
has another course for that, which is their own intro to HTML. This course simply taught you the basics of how markdown was going
to work, and how to use it. I think the idea of having a markdown course and an HTML one is quite smart, especially if you're a
beginner when it comes to code. This warms you up quite a bit for HTML, which isn't much more confusing than this, but it allows
Github to elaborate more into HTML and use terms that they know you'll understand since you took the markdown course.</p>
        <h3 class ="module" id="microbit">Microbit</h3>
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewR-AYJ/ICS4U-Portfolio-AndrewR/master/microbit.PNG" title="Github.com"/img>
          <p>Microbit was a very interesting concept to be able to work on. It allowed us to use the skills we were developping through
Khan academy in a new fashion. This project had us using these small microbits that had multiple programmable features.
Mohammed and I had worked on bluetooth, where the microbit would make a sound and could be controlled using bluetooth (outputted
through devices, controlled on the phone).

  This can be used to further my knowledge since it's almost unconventional. Coding on a
Microbit is different from coding on a program since the microbit has features that you can interact with in real life, since it's
a physical object you can hold. This lets you put your coding skills into practice in a different way, instead of always getting an
output on screen. This can make coding more interesting if you're not used to it, especially since the Microbit has features that
are specific only to itself, since, again, it's a physical object. It's a very special piece of technology that can do many things,
and help you look at code at multiple different angles.

  This is also what had the most impact on me. While I had a good time coding on Khan Academy and coding in C++ last year, the
Microbit was something I have never seen before in my life. It was interesting to see everything you were doing appear on a small
CPU. The tutorials given where also great, and gave me insight on things I've never even though of coding before, since either I
wasn't experienced enough on they weren't possible/conventional on something that wasn't a Microbit. Since I also didn't know
JavaScript well at the time, the use of the block coding helped me built my logic and my ability to produce functioning code in
general, which is always good to have.</p>
