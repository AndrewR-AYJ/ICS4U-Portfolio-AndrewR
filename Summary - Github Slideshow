Github Slideshow

  The Github slideshow is an introductory course to Github and all of it's features. It gives you the basics of how to use 
everything on github and how to get the max value out of it. It teaches you why Github is useful and why you would want to use it
for your projects. I really enjoyed this course because of my introduction to Github, which I think is an important platform for
any aspiring computer scientists.

  To continue to learn about Github, I'll put any projects or websites I complete on the website so that I can make sure I have a
complete understanding of everything I'm doing. I can also start projects with friends of mine, and we can all work on a repository
together to get it done. This would get me used to and teach me things about the collaborative aspect to Github, which is one of
it's strongest features. I could also simply help a stranger on one of their projects, or just review their code and make comments
on it to suggest improvements. There are plenty of things I can find on Github that would make me a more active member of it's
community.

  The thing that had an impact on me from this module was definetly just the ability I have now to use Github. Github is, in my
opinion, very important for any computer scientist to use. You can put everything you make here and have not only a safe, easy
access place for it, but also a place where others can help you with your code. There are so many users on Github that are all
ready and willing to lend you a helping hand, no matter your skill level. That is always great to have, and something that should
really be valued. Even if comments aren't made specifically on your code, you have a huge FAQ section you can visit to try and find
a solution to any problem you might be having, or to help others with theirs. This is a great community that I'm proud to be a part
of.
